## 1. What are proteins?

Proteins are polymers(one or multiple chains) of amino acid residues. They are an integral part of all living organism, and play an indispensable role in a variety of body functions such as DNA/RNA replication, structural development, transportation, etc.

## 2. What are amino acids?

Amino acids are organic compounds containing **amino** as well as **carboxylic acid** groups in their molecular structure.

## 3. How are the structures of proteins determined?

The structures of proteins are most commonly determined by the process of **X-Ray Crystallography**, the discovery of which was a culmination of continued efforts, especially in the early 20th Century.

## 4. What are the different types of protein structures?

The simplest structures of proteins are their primary ones, which can be represented as a linear sequence of amino acids. Secondary structures are more complicated and maybe represented in the form of helices or sheets. Additionally, we can have tertiary and quaternary structures.
