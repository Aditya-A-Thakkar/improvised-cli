# An overview of different force fields:

## AMBER Force Field
AMBER (Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement) is the collected name for a number of programs which conducts molecular dynamics simulations.  
It can model many biomolecules like protein, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates etc. 

### What AMBER Does:

A mathematical equation represents the form of AMBER, described below:

- Represents bond covalent bond energies.
- Energy due to position of electron orbitals.
- Accounts for torsional strain.
- Represents Van-der Waal and electrostatic energies.

### Representation of Atoms
It employs an all-atom model, that is, all atoms are explicitly represented. (Hydrogen not mentioned seperately)

### Parameter Sets:

To use AMBER, one needs to provide various parameters like bond length, bond angles, charges, equilibrium bond length etc. Each parameter set is defined by an OFF or PREP file.

### Force Field:

- Bond stretching and angle bending are modelled as harmonic potential (1/2 * k (x - x<sub>o</sub>)<sup>2</sup>).
- Dihedral angles (torsional strain) is modelled by periodic potential (mathematical model contains potential energy, amplitude etc. as parameters)
- Electrostatic (Coulombâ€™s law) and Van der Waals (Lennard-Jones Potential)

### Recommended Force Fields

Random usage of force field is highly discouraged for modelling. There are certain force fields which work well for certain molecules/ions. Here is a list given below (Source: The Amber Project).  

| Molecule/Ion | Force Field |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Protein      | ff19SB      |
| DNA          | OL21        |
| RNA          | OL3         |
| Carbohydrates| GLYCAM_06j  |
| Lipids       |lipids21     |

## CHARMM - Chemistry at HARvard Macromolecular Mechanics

- similar to amber but provides more parameters.
- treats all the atoms separately to find potential energy.
- Also provides parameters to include polarized charges (an advantage over amber)
- target molecules are - proteins, nucleic acids and membranes.

### Atomic representation
- Each atom is a point charge
- For practical purposes, Hydrogen atoms are combined with nearby atoms to give an extended atomic repr.

### Empirical Energy Function
- Uses some formulae to calculate potential energy of the system.
- Accounts for bond potential, bond angle potential, torsion angle potential, van der Walls forces, and electrostatic potential.


### Generation of data structure - to calculate potential
- Sophisticated shit

### Mechanics and Energetics
- The system tends to achieve a state of low energy. 
- Thus, it is desirable to calculate minima of energy, and adjust the coordinates of the system.
- Along with this, there is also a trajectory - due to initial velocity of the atoms.
- Due to computational complexity, it becomes impossible to calculate global minima, and we will have to suffice w/ a local minima.
